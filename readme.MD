## Introduction
Recursion is a powerful technique in computer science where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to recursion with practical examples and exercises.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recursion-project.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd recursion-project
```

## Examples
In the `examples` directory, you will find various recursive algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Each example includes a detailed explanation of how the recursion works.

## Exercises
The `exercises` directory contains a set of problems designed to test and improve your understanding of recursion. Try to solve these problems on your own before looking at the provided solutions.

## Contributing
